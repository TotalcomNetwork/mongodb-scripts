# Backup remote DB 

Backup a remote DB. The backup files are stored on the remote machine.

Create a `.env` file and provide the required variables (check-out the `.env.reference` for the description of the required variables).

Run the script and pass the `.env` file as argument

```
./backup-remote-db ".env"
```

... wait for the backup to finish.
